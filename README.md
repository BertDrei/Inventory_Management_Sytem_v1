# Inventory Management System v1

## My First Inventory Management System

This project represents my initial attempt at creating an Inventory Management System, serving as valuable practice in the realm of inventory system management. The inspiration behind multiple inventory management projects in my repository stems from my professor's preference for such projects in my computer science course. While I've started with inventory systems, my ambition is to diversify and take on more challenging projects in the future.

## About the System

This inventory management system, developed using Java Swing in NetBeans, follows the conventional structure of recording inventory, processing orders, and other essential functions. While the software may be slightly outdated, I recommend running the program in the NetBeans IDE for optimal performance.

## How to Use

1. **Install NetBeans:**
   - Download and install NetBeans IDE from [https://netbeans.apache.org/](https://netbeans.apache.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DreiBert/Inventory_Management_Systemv1.git
